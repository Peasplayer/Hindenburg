Plugins in Hindenburg give you fine-grained control to your server, whether you're making gamemodes, working with client mods or connecting Hindenburg with external services, plugins are perfect, and are especially easy to install and write yourself.

### Installing plugins
Installing, configuring and using plugins should be a breeze, and for a [good majority of cases is just a single command](../Using%20Hindenburg/CLI%20Commands.html#install-plugin), as plugins can be installed from either a [github repository](https://github.com), or directly from [npm](https://npmjs.com).
